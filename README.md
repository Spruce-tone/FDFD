# FDFD
Finite-difference frequency-domain method python tutorial. The FDFD method refers to the Finite-Difference Frequency-Domain method, which is a numerical technique used in electromagnetics and optics to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the behavior of electromagnetic waves in a given system. It is a widely used method for simulations of various electromagnetic problems.
